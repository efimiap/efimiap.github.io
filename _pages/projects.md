          <b>RobotCycle Project: Mapping and Understanding Road Infrastructure and Road User Behaviour</b> <br/>
          The goal of this project is to gain insights on how cycling infrastructure can affect the behaviour and safety of cyclists during their journeys. Project outcomes will inform the decision making of different stakeholders (incl. cyclists, other road users, city planners, and/or policy-makers).  <br/>
