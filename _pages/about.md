I am a third and final year PhD student at the [School of Informatics, University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/informatics/) and member of [EdinburghNLP](https://edinburghnlp.inf.ed.ac.uk/) under the supervision of [Mirella Lapata](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/mlap/index.php) and [Frank Keller](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/keller/). I am interested in  language grounding and multimodal NLP, representation learning, multimodal/multi-view learning, self-supervised learning, graph structures/graph neural networks (GNNs), latent variable models, summarization and question-answering. Currently, my PhD thesis is focused on the analysis and summarization of long-form narratives, such as movies and TV episodes, by identifying and exploiting their underlying structure as latent information. Part of my thesis also explores fine-grained relations between narrative events by constructing sparse graph structures and exploiting multimodal information extracted from different views of the movie (e.g., screenpays, videos).

Before that, I completed my diploma (combined BEng and MEng) at the [National Technical University of Athens](https://www.ntua.gr/en/) in Athens, Greece, department of [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.ece.ntua.gr/en). In my diploma thesis, I addressed the task of dialogue act classification and explored ways in order to incorporate speakers' intentions and emotions in personality identification, under the supervision of [Alex Potamianos](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=pBQViyUAAAAJ&hl=en).
