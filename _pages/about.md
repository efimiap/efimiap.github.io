I am a second-year PhD student at the [School of Informatics, University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/informatics/) and member of [EdinburghNLP](https://edinburghnlp.inf.ed.ac.uk/) under the supervision of [Mirella Lapata](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/mlap/index.php) and [Frank Keller](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/keller/). I am interested in summarization, question-answering (open-domain or long-form), latent variable models, multi-modal processing and graph structures. Currently, my PhD thesis is focused on the analysis and summarization of long-form narratives, such as movies and TV episodes, by identifying and exploiting their underlying structure as latent information. Part of my thesis also explores relations between narrative events based on multi-modal information.

Before that, I completed my diploma (combined BEng and MEng) at the [National Technical University of Athens](https://www.ntua.gr/en/) in Athens, Greece, department of [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.ece.ntua.gr/en). In my diploma thesis, I addressed the task of dialogue act classification and explored ways in order to incorporate speakers' intentions and emotions in personality identification, under the supervision of [Alex Potamianos](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=pBQViyUAAAAJ&hl=en).
