I am a second-year PhD student at the [School of Informatics, University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/informatics/) and member of [EdinburghNLP](https://edinburghnlp.inf.ed.ac.uk/). I am co-supervised by Prof. [Mirella Lapata](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/mlap/index.php) and Prof. [Frank Keller](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/keller/). My PhD thesis is focused on tasks like summarization and question-answering in the context of narratives by exploiting the underlying narrative structure. I am also interested in investigating such topics in multi-modal settings and exploring fusion methods among modalities.

Before that, I completed my diploma (combined BEng and MEng) at the [National Technical University of Athens](https://www.ntua.gr/en/) in Athens, Greece, department of [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.ece.ntua.gr/en). In my diploma thesis, I addressed the task of dialogue act classification and explored ways in order to incorporate speakers' intentions and emotions in personality identification, under the supervision of Prof. [Alex Potamianos](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=pBQViyUAAAAJ&hl=en).
