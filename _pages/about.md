I am a final year DPhil (PhD) student at [MRG](https://ori.ox.ac.uk/labs/mobile-robotics-group/) and [CRG](https://ori.ox.ac.uk/labs/cognitive-robotics-group/) at the [Oxford Robotics Institute](https://ori.ox.ac.uk/), University of Oxford, supervised by [Daniele De Martini](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=F7QcGh0AAAAJ&hl=en), [Paul Newman](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=BtO5fTUAAAAJ&hl=en), and [Lars Kunze](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=TLC0azYAAAAJ&hl=en). For my studies, I have been awarded the Oxford - Google DeepMind research scholarship. 

Currently, I am also working part-time at [OXA](https://oxa.tech/) as Senior ML Engineer, at the Office of the CTO. Before starting my DPhil, I was working as Lead Self-Driving Software Engineer at [StreetDrone](https://www.streetdrone.com/) (acquired by OXA) and worked as Data Engineer at [Williams Racing](https://www.williamsf1.com/), [Formula 1](https://www.formula1.com/).

I finished my MEng in 2017 at [NTUA](https://www.ntua.gr/en/), Greece, department of [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.ece.ntua.gr/en). During my studies, I spent time at [ETH ZÃ¼rich](https://ethz.ch/en.html) conducting my master's thesis at the [Computer Vision Lab](https://vision.ee.ethz.ch/) under the supervision of [Prof Luc Van Gool](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=TwMib_QAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Dr Dengxin Dai](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=T51W57YAAAAJ&hl=en), working with [AMZ Driverless](https://www.amzracing.ch/en).

Inspired by the significant unknowns of real-world robot deployment, I am investigating the topics of representation learning and scene understanding for ground robotics applications. 

*Keywords: 3D spatial robotic perception, scene understanding, graph neural networks, multimodal semantic localisation, neural algorithmic reasoning, learning by abstraction, and explainable AI.*

Always happy to connect and start new collaborations!
