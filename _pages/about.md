I am currently a 4th year DPhil (PhD) student at the [Mobile Robotics Group](https://ori.ox.ac.uk/labs/mobile-robotics-group/) and the [Cognitive Robotics Group](https://ori.ox.ac.uk/labs/cognitive-robotics-group/) of the [Oxford Robotics Institute](https://ori.ox.ac.uk/), [University of Oxford](https://www.ox.ac.uk/), supervised by [Dr Daniele De Martini](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=F7QcGh0AAAAJ&hl=en) and [Prof Lars Kunze](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=TLC0azYAAAAJ&hl=en). My DPhil is funded by [Google DeepMind](https://deepmind.google/) through the [Department of Engineering Science](https://eng.ox.ac.uk/). During my studies, I am working part-time at [OXA](https://oxa.tech/) as Senior ML Engineer (Reasoning), at the Office of the CTO, [Prof Paul Newman](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=BtO5fTUAAAAJ&hl=en).

Before starting my DPhil I was working as the Lead Self-Driving Software Engineer at [StreetDrone Ltd](https://www.streetdrone.com/) and was responsible for the software development of a prototype [self-driving truck]((https://www.streetdrone.com/streetdrone-autonomous-deliveries-nissan/)) for a 5G-enabled CAL project in the Nissan factory, part of the [5G Create Scheme](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/5g-create). Prior to that, I was working as Software Engineer (June 2018-2020) at [StreetDrone Ltd](https://www.streetdrone.com/) and developed a [full-stack self-driving software](https://github.com/project-aslan/Aslan/tree/melodic) for the Nissan ENV200 and Renault Twizy for the [SMLL Urban AV Trials](https://smartmobility.london/test), [CCAV and Innovate UK project](https://apply-for-innovation-funding.service.gov.uk/competition/103/overview). I also worked as Data Processing Engineer at [Williams Racing](https://www.williamsf1.com/), [Formula 1](https://www.formula1.com/) team.

I finished my diploma (5-years Integrated BEng and MEng degree) in 2017 at the [National Technical University of Athens](https://www.ntua.gr/en/) in Athens, Greece, department of [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.ece.ntua.gr/en). During my studies, I spent 8 months at [ETH ZÃ¼rich](https://ethz.ch/en.html) conducting my master's thesis at the [Computer Vision Lab](https://vision.ee.ethz.ch/) under the supervision of [Prof Luc Van Gool](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=TwMib_QAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Dr Dengxin Dai](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=T51W57YAAAAJ&hl=en), working with the [AMZ Driverless Formula Student Team](https://www.amzracing.ch/en).

Inspired by the significant unknowns of real-world robot deployment, I am investigating the topics of representation learning and scene understanding for ground robotics applications. 

*Keywords: 3D spatial robotic perception, representation learning, scene understanding, graph structures/graph neural networks, vision-language models, multimodal semantic localisation, neural execution of graph algorithms, learning by abstraction, and explainable AI.*

Always happy to connect and start new collaborations!
