I am currently a DPhil (PhD) student at the [Cognitive Robotics Group](https://ori.ox.ac.uk/labs/cognitive-robotics-group/) of the [Oxford Robotics Institute](https://ori.ox.ac.uk/), [University of Oxford](https://www.ox.ac.uk/), supervised by [Lars Kunze](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=TLC0azYAAAAJ&hl=en). My DPhil is funded by [Google DeepMind](https://deepmind.google/) through the [Department of Engineering Science](https://eng.ox.ac.uk/). 

Before starting my DPhil I was working as Lead Self-Driving Software Engineer (June 2020-October 2021) and Software Engineer (June 2018-2020) at [StreetDrone Ltd](https://www.streetdrone.com/). I also worked as Data Processing Engineer at [Williams Racing](https://www.williamsf1.com/), [Formula 1](https://www.formula1.com/) team.

I finished my diploma (5-years Integrated BEng and MEng degree) in 2017 at the [National Technical University of Athens](https://www.ntua.gr/en/) in Athens, Greece, department of [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.ece.ntua.gr/en). During my studies I spent 8 months at [ETH ZÃ¼rich](https://ethz.ch/en.html) conducting my master thesis at the [Computer Vision Lab](https://vision.ee.ethz.ch/) under the supervision of [Prof Luc Van Gool](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=TwMib_QAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Dr Dengxin Dai](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=T51W57YAAAAJ&hl=en), working at the [AMZ Driverless Formula Student Team](https://www.amzracing.ch/en).

Inspired by the significant unknowns of real-world robot deployment, I am investigating the topics of scene understanding and situational awareness for ground robotics applications. 

*Keywords: 3D spatial robotic perception, multimodal semantic localisation, representation learning, scene understanding, graph structures/graph neural networks, foundation models, neural execution of graph algorithms, learning by abstraction, and explainable AI.*

Always happy to connect and start new collaborations!
