I am a final year PhD student at the [School of Informatics, University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/informatics/) and member of [EdinburghNLP](https://edinburghnlp.inf.ed.ac.uk/) under the supervision of [Mirella Lapata](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/mlap/index.php) and [Frank Keller](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/keller/). I am interested in  language grounding and multimodal NLP, representation learning, self-supervised learning, graph structures/graph neural networks (GNNs), latent variable models, summarization and memory-augmented language modeling. My PhD thesis focuses on structure-aware movie understanding and summarization. 

Before that, I completed my diploma (combined BEng and MEng) at the [National Technical University of Athens](https://www.ntua.gr/en/) in Athens, Greece, department of [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.ece.ntua.gr/en).

Recently, I also interned with the Language team at [DeepMind](https://deepmind.com/) with [Tomas Kocisky](http://www.tomas.kocisky.eu/) and [Kris Cao](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=_KBP8ZgAAAAJ&hl=en), and with the Computer Vision team at [MetaAI](https://ai.facebook.com/) with [Marcus Rohrbach](https://rohrbach.vision/).

I will soon finish my PhD and be on the job market!
